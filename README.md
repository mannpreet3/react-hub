This repository contains a selection of React projects I built while learning frontend development. 
I have worked on many projects during my learning journey, but only a few representative examples are included here.

## Projects / Topics Included

   - Fetching and displaying data from public APIs using `fetch` or `axios`.

2. **Side Effects with useEffect**  
   - Handling lifecycle events, data fetching, and side effects using React's `useEffect` hook.

3. **Authentication**  
   - Implementing login/logout flows and protected routes in React apps.

4. **Avoid Prop Drilling with Context API & useReducer**  
   - Managing global state and reducing prop drilling using React Context and `useReducer`.

5. **Routing**
